Reports
Server Information: Selecting the Server Information page routes to the Dnr which consists of general information and evaluation. After that, the person has to enter the details about scode,  sname,  stype,  ssize and samt. If the scode already exists, error message is displayed on the screen. If it does not, then the values are inserted into the Dnr Table. The inserted values are displayed on the screen.

Customer Information: Choosing the Customer Information page routes to the customer table which consists of general information and Evaluation. After that, the person has to enter the details about cno, cname, company, addr, phone, cmid and password. If the cno already exists, the screen displays error message. If it does not, then the values are inserted into the customer table. The inserted values are displayed on the screen.

Feasibility Study:

It is always a wise thing to perform the feasibility study of a project. Months or years of effort, thousands and millions of dollars, and untold professional embarrassment can all be eradicated if an ill-conceived system is recognized early in the development or definition phase. The feasibility studies of this Web Server Management system in Java include the following:

Technical Feasibility: It is the need of hardware and software which are needed to implement the proposed system in the organization. Like in all project-proposals, the technical requirements are to be fulfilled to make the proposed system work. This should be necessarily predetermined so as to make the system more competent.
Economical Feasibility: Under this, the project must satisfy the needs of the technical feasibility and the operational feasibility. It involves the economic feasibility of developing and implementing the proposed system.
Operational Feasibility: The proposed system uses internet by which different types of end users are involved in the system; it solves the users’ needs and the company’s needs. Also, it supports the all user environments.
